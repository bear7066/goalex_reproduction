    "Archive-name: ripem/attacks\nLast-update: 31 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500\n\nSOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON RIPEM\n------------------------------\n\nThis is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open\nfor when using RIPEM for secure electronic mail.  It does not go into\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\n\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\n---------------------\n\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\n  messages with your private key.\n\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\n  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\n  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\n\n- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\n  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\n  an attacker to claim to be you.\n\n  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\n  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\n  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\n  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\n  remain high.\n\nKEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\n----------------------\n\n- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\n  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\n  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\n  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\n  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\n\n  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\n  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run \n  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\n  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\n  which nobody else has physical access to.\n\n- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \n  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\n  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\n  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\n  the other bogus public key and pass them along.\n\n  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\n  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\n  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \n  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\n  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\n  not always practical.  Having other people \"vouch for you\" by\n  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \n  RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as\n  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\n  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\n  authentication.\n\nPLAYBACK ATTACKS\n----------------\n\n- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\n  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\n  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\n  to Alice which says \"OK, let's do that.\" Your opponent intercepts\n  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\n  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\n  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\n  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\n  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\n  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \n  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\n  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\n  unknown message.\n\n  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \n  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\n  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\n  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\n  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\n  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\n  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\n  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\n  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\n  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\n  the utils directory.\n\nLOCAL ATTACKS\n-------------\n\n- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\n  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\n  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\n  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\n  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\n  the plaintext, depending how it's stored.\n\n  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\n  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\n  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\n  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\n  passphrase.)\n\n  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\n  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\n  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\n  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\n  viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between\n  convenience and security here.\n\n  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\n  where other people have access (even root access), but increase\n  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\n  course) executable on a floppy disk.\n\n  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\n  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\n  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\n  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\n  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just\n  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\n  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\n  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\n  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\n  cleartext password authentication.\n\n  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\n  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\n  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\n  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\n  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\n  with greater care for critical correspondence.\n\nUNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\n-------------------------\n\n- RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\n  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\n  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\n  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \n  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\n  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\n  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\n  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\n  states that such transformations should be possible to allow\n  forwarding functions to work.",
    "I deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the \nspecific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce.  \n\n\n\nI have thought about the implications, and it is scary.  \n\nWe have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have \ndecided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the\nthrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is\nlegitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's\ndecision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can\nhave a more \"deep, committed relationship.\"\n\nMarriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life.\nLove is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.\n\nIs it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many \nyears who stayed home to care for the children because he\ncan't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful\nyoung blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to\nmake a renewed effort.  \n\nHold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His\nrelation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We\nlearn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and\nremain faithful through times of trial.\n\nMy spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed.\nIf it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!)\nthen perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual\nrelations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me\npermission to seek someone else to satisfy my \"needs.\"  \n\nThe idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple \"grows apart\"\nseems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning\nof marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint\nof compromise.  We have become so petty and small-minded that\nsome husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the\nwives lose weight!",
    "\"Deeply rooted rivalry?\" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined\nthe top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since\n1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think\nyou're exagerating here.\n\n\nThat's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &\nAmerican Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our\nset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\n---\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\n\n(28-30=superstar)\n(23-27=star)\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\n(13-17=NHL regular)\n( 8-12=role player)\n\nFINLAND:  \n\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\n\nC-Jari Kurri........25\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\n\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\n\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\n\nSWEDEN:\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\nD-Calle Johansson...18\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\n\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\nC-Thomas Steen......18\n\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\nR-Michael Nylander..13\n\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\nL-Jan Erixon........14\n\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\n---\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late '80s. \nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone.",

    "This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to\n_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone\ncomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the\ncontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads\nis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the\nfamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.\nThe letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that\nNefertiti was \"a beautiful black queen.\"  This set off an exchange of\nhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had\nan article from an Egyptologist titled \"Was Cleopatra Black?\"  (The answer\nto the title is \"no\"-- she was greek.)\n\nI have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I\npersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in\nWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary\nenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark\nhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and\ndown the Mediterranean.\n\n(Also, if what I remember is correct, the \"Black Madonna\" doesn't represent\na person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe\nBuehler....?)\n\nIn the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that\ngreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,\nthe situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,\nor various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about\nthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then\nthere are the Ethiopians....\n\nThose of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these\npeople are \"white\" (i.e., of the racist's \"race\").  If I may risk a\npotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the\nidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering\nthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval\nantisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \"Jesus was white\" thesis\never played the roles that some hold it did.\n\nRepresentations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems\nawfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.",
    "At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame\nwar, I must disagree.\n\t\n\tThere is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often\nchosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does\nbasically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the\nfact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less\ntraining time required. \n\n\tSmith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht\nthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which\nif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun\nfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and\nwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various \ngun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little\ntest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and\nshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times\nwere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.\n\n\tYou don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing\ncity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..\n\n\tOf course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\nchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that\n'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time\nto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.\n\n\tDon't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks\nin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.

AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\n   This stuck them as strange, until now...\n\n\n   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\nconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:\n\n  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\n\n  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\n    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\n    of the government.\n\n  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\n    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\n\n  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\n    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\n    changing the keys themselves.\n\n  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\n    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\n    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\n    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\n    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\n    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\n\nAdditonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell\nme much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.\nHowever he told me a little:\n\n - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\n   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\n   secure.\n\n - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\n   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\n   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\n   the following:\n\n    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\n      Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\n\n    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\n\n    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\n\n    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\n      it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\n\n    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\n      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\n      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\n      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\n\n    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\n      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\n      hardware chip.\n\n    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\n      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\n      enough, which probably won't happen]).\n\n    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\n      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\n      data into \"blocks.\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\n      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\n      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\n\n    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\n\n\n\nRight now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\nof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\nstopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their\ngovernment not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.\n\n\nExcept from the government.\n\n\nHuh? Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.\n\n\nIn short, the new technology can:\n\n1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.\n\nIt cannot:\n\n1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its\nability to decrypt the conversations.\n\n2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new\nencryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who\nhandle them, etc.\n\n3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for\ncommunication.\n\n\n\nCorrect.

Besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination\nand the ones built into your phones will be the same?\n\n\n\nThe NSA and the FBI?\n\n\n\nWhy did they \"forget\" the Academia?\n\n\n\nDoesn't this smell to monopolism?\n\n\n\nLike the Mafia?\n\n\nThis is the main question, why was it buried at the end?\n\n\n\"We'll see\".\n\n\n\"Trust us\".\n\n\nIn short, \"If we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you\".\n\n\nSince the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions\nand since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American\nto bear arms, why is not every American entitled, as a matter of\nright, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?\n\n\nBullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security,\nencryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the\nencryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and\nis a step to outlaw strong crypto.\n\n\n\nWho was the optimist who believed that the new administration will\nleave the export controls on strong crypto devices?\n\nOK, I'm not American, it's not my business, but I just couldn't resist\nto comment...

    "One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was\nthe Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just\nbeen released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed\nseveral monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the\nNanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last\nyear.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the\nranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing\ncriteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I\nscored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it\nscored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.\n\nIncidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading\nreviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the\ncriteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product\ntesting was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly\nknow what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently\nfrom Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the\nranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet\nyour needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of\nwhat we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply\nmore closely in one review than in another.

    "I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\nSteve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \nMed. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \nno idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I \nknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine's doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\nIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107",

    "Printer model and specification:\n\nCanon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier)\nps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)\n\n\nHello,\n\nWe have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer. \nWe want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The \ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\nprinter with the \"lp\" system using the parallel interface and can print \npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\nand translating the image into postscript.\n\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \nsome assurance that the product will work.\n\n\nHere my questions:\n\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \nparallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?\n\nIs there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the\nlimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on \nthe printer?\n \nThe Big question:\n\nWhere can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?\n\n\n\nPlease email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis. \nI will post a summary.\n\nThanks in advance.",

    "True in theory.  In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will\nprobably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext\nwithout the key.

The\ntelco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule\ntoday.\n\nBut even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\njudge so ordered.

They designed the system to make it\ndifficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the\nfourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the\ngovernment to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John\nHancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.\n\nThink about it.

With tools\nlike this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be\nsuccessfully imposed.\n\nWhy give the government tools with which to enslave you?

Often, they are replaced by\ndictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never\never ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and\nthe lives of your children and other loved ones on it?\n\nIf we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we\nmake it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because\nif it happened with the tools already in place it could actually\nstick. \n\nNaive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where\nhundreds that have gone before have failed.

    "Archive-name: space/astronaut\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $\n\nHOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT\n\n    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA\n    announcement.\n\n    Q. How do I become an astronaut?\n\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\n    specialist\".\n\n    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\n    experimental operations.\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ===========================\n\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\n    --------------------------------\n\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\n    submitting an application.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be\n    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's\n    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic\n    preparation is important.\n\n    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a\n    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/150 or better uncorrected,\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    3.

Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\n    academic preparation is important.\n\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\n    test experience highly desirable.\n\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/50 or better uncorrected\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\n\n    Citizenship Requirements\n\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\n    the United States.\n\n    Note on Academic Requirements\n\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\n\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\n\tMedical Technology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\n\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\n\n    Application Procedures\n    ----------------------\n\n    Civilian\n\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\n\n\tNASA Johnson Space Center\n\tAstronaut Selection Office\n\tATTN: AHX\n\tHouston, TX 77058\n\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years.

    "[...]\n\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\n\n   [Reproduced without permission]\n\n\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\n\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\n\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\n\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\n\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\n\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\n\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\n\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\n\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\n\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\n\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\n\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\n\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\n\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\n\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\n\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\n\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\n\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\n\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\n\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\n\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\n\n\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\n\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\n\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\n\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\n\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\n\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\n\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm\n\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the\n\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\n\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association's\n\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\n\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\n\tclean bill of health.\n\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\n\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\n\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\n\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\n\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\n\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\n\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\n\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\n\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\n\tof selected foods omitted]\n\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\n\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\n\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\n\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\n\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\n\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\n\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\n\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\n\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\n\tContains Phenylalanine.\"",

We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft\nunits.\"\n\nTurkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the\nconflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which\nmore than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.\n\nThe Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to\nAzerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.\n\nA Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly\non a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket\nlaunchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.\n\nDuliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops\nand arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where\nthey were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.\n\n\"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the\ncountry which is affording military assistance over our airspace,\" he said.\n\nArmenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops \ninvolved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.\n\nTass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive\nalong the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.\n\n\"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent\ninspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)\nleadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,\" the agency said.\n\nArmenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in\nKarabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of\nCommonwealth leaders.\n\n\"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the\nprotection of the Karabakh population,\" Tass quoted him as saying.\n     \nAt least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have\ncollapsed.\n\n\"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the\nlegal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,\" he\nsaid. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not \nbeen recognised by any other country.\n\nArmenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future\npeace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.\n\nLocal news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender\nGamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with\nArmenia, had resigned.\n\nTuran news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.\nKhabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of\nBaku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev.

He's\ntelling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen\nbefore his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his\npower openly visible.\n\nBy the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me\nthat he is claiming to be Christ.",

On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\n\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.

Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\n\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\nindex is near the optimal level.\n\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\n\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10.

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\ndata from this test are being conducted.

    "That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about\nprospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of\nFame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked \nat players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they\nwere 24, and noticed some interesting things. \n\n  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in\nthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented the\nmajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that\nthey actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers\nlasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  \nfound that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and\nproduced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first\ngroup outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away\nthe second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. \n\n  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory. \n\n  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.",

The system for the\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\nfor the other 40-bit key.\n\nSimilarly, it didn't say \"We're making encryption is commercially available.\"\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\n\nThe next thing it didn't say is \"We're making encryption legal\",\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\nPresident can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\n\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\n\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\n\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\nwhich clearly means \"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\nSoon.  Once business buys into this.\"\n\nAnother thing it didn't say is \"We're going to ask Congress for money\nto do *lots* more wiretapping\", because of course, there's a budget crisis,\nand Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\n   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct\n   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\n   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\n   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\n   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\nwhich means \"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to\nbuy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO\n(that's what \"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\" \nmeans.)",

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\nour lives into \"before\" and ''after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\nlosses and everything that happened.\n\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \nthose who didn't.\n\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was\nnear and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\n\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\nlike it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a \nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\n\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \nexpected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out \nof the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\"\n\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \nme. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \nwas thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to \nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\nexcited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They \ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \nroom. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\n\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, \nthey don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \nyour children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your \nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people \namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm \na teacher.\n\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \nhim in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \nbut a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were \ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \nMamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I'm old enough to \nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he's being held, \nMamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, \nwho's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \nmustn't do it. She said, \"Come on, let's straighten this out, without \nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \ncame here to kill them.\"\n\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \ndidn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\n\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\ndid to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \nthey beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but \ndidn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \nkicking her, using anything they could find.\n\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, \njust didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let's take her \noutside.\"\n\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \nweren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't \nafraid of what would happen to them.\n\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \nwith blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \nI were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm \nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold \na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, \nand I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\n\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\nhe's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \nI felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I \njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the \nground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\n\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't \nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth \nliving.\n\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \nalthough, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that \nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \nforget it.\n\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\n\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to \nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it \nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \nfrom the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, \n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\n\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even \nremember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\nthere by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell \nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad \nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\n\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \nneighbors.\n\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\n \nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \nsure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone \nsaid, \"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a \nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember\nwhose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \tI having opened my \neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \nbeen beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only \nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \nI can't remember anything more.\n\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot \nabout him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\nif he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \nUfa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \nall out later.\n\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \nof the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is \nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \ndidn't want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \nentirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting \nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. \nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the \ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone \nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.\n\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's \nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm \na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, \nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. \nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\n\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \nand money in your apartment we'll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \nover and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one \nanother right then.\n\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, \nhalfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, \nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\n\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \nthreshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\n\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \nwas already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \nthat all of that would die with me.\n\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \ndidn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\nI would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in \nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \nor not. He said, \"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\" In the third \nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \nalready taken the other.\n\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\n\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\nThat's just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I'll drive\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\nand nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \nThat's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\n\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. \nMarina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\n\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the \nneighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're \nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\n\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What's the mat-\nter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \nhe couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \ntold him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\ngood terms with them.\n\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \nopened the door and immediately said, \"I'm an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \nLet her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows\nabout this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a \nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid \nto go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see \nwho's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, \nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \nstill there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\n\nI went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \ndon't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were \nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport \njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \nAnd again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to \nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know \nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \nhad never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on \nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. \nI tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in \nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\n\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\nchildren's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. \nAll these years I've been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \n\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and\nleft.\n\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \nvery often.\n\n\t\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

In the Mac and some PCs\n this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers\n AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the \n slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode \n 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous\n mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}\n\nSCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things\n over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the\n machine and the external device.\n Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver\n software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.\n Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.\n\nSCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this\n requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING\n devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY\n expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts",

    "Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For\nexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n\"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  \n\nI've heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n\"drift\" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?",
    "WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi \nSS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to \"the extermination of the\nJewish race\"--went on display Friday at the National Archives.\n\tThe documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are\namong the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the\nHolocaust is a myth, archivists say.\n\t\"The notes give them their authenticity,\" said Robert Wolfe,\na supervisory archivist for captured German records.  \"He was\nsupposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his\nown rules.\"\n\tThe documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped\nwould be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after\nWorld War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.\n\tHimmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than\n100 German secret police generals.  \"I also want to talk to you,\nquite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be\nmentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.\nI mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish\nrace.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been\nwritten and is never to be written.\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]\n\tThe German word Himmler uses that is translated as\n\"extermination\" is *Ausrottung*.\n\tWolfe said a more precise translation would be \"extirpation\"\nor \"tearing up by the roots.\"\n\tIn his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,\n\"Judenevakuierung\" or \"evacuation of the Jews.\"  But archives\nofficials said \"extermination\" is the word he actually\nspoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.\n\tHimmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's \"final solution of the\nJewish question,\" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.\n\tThe National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is\na preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum here on April 26.\n\tThe National Archives exhibit includes a page each of\nHimmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and\nan offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.\n\n\t---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

    "Reply-To: pwhite@empros.com\n \n \nHere in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they\nthink of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our \nculture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather\nthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer \nan initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to\ntreat church as they would a club and when something is less than to\ntheir liking, off they go to another one.\n\nI think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different \nperspective on the \"church choosing process\". It seems to me from 1Cor 12\nthat God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all\nbut that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better\nquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where\nGod is trying to place me.\n\nIf a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they\ngo to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of\nGod. People should hop around from church to church as often as they\nhop from natural family to family.\n\nIf you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an \neasily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more\nlike an orphan. Prayerfully go and \"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\"\nand see if anyplace feels like home. \n\nI wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you\nhave difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand\nthere are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking\nfor problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand\nif you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that\nwherever you go. \n\nIn general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that\ntalks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is\nexpanding on that base.",

    "I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in\na neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n\nFelix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.\nMaybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.\n\n\nI'd put him about there too.  \n\nNote: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's \nworse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are \nother players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.\nIt's got some error.\n\nOh well.\n\nBill Guilford",

    "I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by\nbuying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile\nI noticed two things about the function generator.

The thing is, in order to\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of\na pain in  the ass.\n\tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd\nlike to have this box not be active.\n\tAny quick ideas. The scope's not broken.

We are not\nsaved by what we do.  However,\n\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n(John 14:15).\n\nKeeping Christ's commandments is a \"work\" per se, and a demonstration of\nour love for him.  Also,\n\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\ndown.\n(Luke 13:6-9).\n\nAgain,\n\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n(John 15:16).\n\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\nin the actions that we carry out.\n\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. \nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\npants is more important.\n\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\ncommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \n\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\nprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for\ndays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a\nbuilding and not hit the ground.

    "The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17\n    To the children of genocide: \"Send them away into the Desert\"\n\nThis is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish \nwartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders \nfor the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these\ntelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,\nfor example, we have the following set regarding children:\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to\n\t the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum\n\t [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem\n\t families and received as servants when they are left alone through\n\t the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect\n\t all such children in your province and send them to the places of\n\t deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to\n\t the people.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [1]\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the\n\t time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their\n\t lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [2]\n\n\t\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.\n\n\t November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the\n\t orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their\n\t places of exile.\n\n\t \t\t\t\tAbdullahad Nuri. [3]\n\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been\n\t opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is\n\t done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt\n\t of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or\n\t any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it\n\t purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as\n\t detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received\n\t into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish\n\t special orphanages for them.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat.\" [4]\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\n\t Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures\n\t to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with\n\t the caravans.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [5]\n\n\t\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows\n\t of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is\n\t not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by\n\t Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble\n\t in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned\n\t out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of\n\t deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent\n\t away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [6]\n\nIn 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs\nabout a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \"rationalizing\" this\nultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:\n\n\t\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for\n\t its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks\n\t it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I\n\t shall die for it.\" [7]\n\n\nThese telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of\nTalaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never\nquestioned these \"death march orders\" until 1986, during a time when the world\nwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.\n\nFor reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the\nTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were\never issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a\nstudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.\n\nIf one were to examine the sample \"authentic text\" provided in the Turkish \nHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it \ntoo would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the \nTurkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or \nPersian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is\na forgery. \n\nToday, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,\nTurkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide \narchitect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a \nheightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a\nfocal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.\n\nThis monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological\ndenial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only\ncrime was to be born Armenian.\n\n\t\t\t- - - references - - -\n\n[1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60\n\n[2] ibid, page 60\n\n[3] ibid, page 60\n\n[4] ibid, page 61\n\n[5] ibid, page 61\n\n[6] ibid, page 62\n\n[7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and\n    London), 1926, page 387",

What was, for that matter, the\nmethodology of Jenner and Pasteur?  \n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I\ndon't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,\nhomeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be\naccepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of\nhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  \n\nWhat some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things\n(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific\nattention.  \n\nIf in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not\nuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is\neffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all\nof current science is based on the past work of scientists whose\nmethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  \n\nIt is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine\nthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is\nalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on \nthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous \nfashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  \n\nBut to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is\ncapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no\nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly\nbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as\ndoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in\nreason.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.",

    "I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders.\nIt's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology,\nand it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the\nproposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what\nexists now.\n \n   The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to\nconcern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA\nhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,\nprobably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the\nexistence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of\npossible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)\na DES keysearch machine.\n \n   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination\ncould acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since\nit would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked\njodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency\nor organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used\nto allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-\nnesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would\ntrust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for\n(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?

How about\nhome phones of major execs and important engineers and designers?\n\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately.\nMaybe I can help...\"\n \n \n   Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely\nas secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.

    "<stuff deleted>\n\n\nGood gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\n\nFor power:\n\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\n\nFor amplitude\n\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\n\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\n\nCommon references for audio are:\n\n\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\n\t0 dBV = 1 volt\n\n\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\n\t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)\n\n\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\nor moment.\n\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******",

    "(Soner Yamen) responded to article <1r20kr$m9q@nic.umass.edu> BURAK@UCSVAX.\n\n[AFS]     Just a quick comment::\n[AFS]\n[AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians.\n[AFS]\n[AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?\n\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \nrevisionists say!\n\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\n\nOK.\n\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\n\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\naway!\n\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\n[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \n\nI don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\n\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\n\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> \nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \nMassachusetts. \n\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\n[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.\n\nMy grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \ntoday.\n\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But\n[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why \n[SY] should they become enemies?",

    "Here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful\nideas about how to choose a church:\n\nColossians 1:15-18\n   A.  Jesus is the head of the body, the church\n   B.  You cannot say \"yes\" to Jesus, but \"no\" to the church\n\nEphesians 2:19-22\n   A.  The church is the family of God\n   B.  The church is based on the Word of God only\n          Cornerstone=Christ\n          Foundation= Apostles=New Testament\n                      Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)\n\n1 Corinthians 12:12-13\n   A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church\n\nAs for the question of denominations:\n   A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians\n4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13\n   B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in\nthe church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church\n(and in time, their writings)\n   C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy\n4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a\nchurch that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle\n\nHebrews 10:24-25\n   A.  Do not miss church\n   B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful.\nInvolved on a relationship level in the church\n   C.  Must come to ALL services\n\nAnother verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be\nencouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.\n\nOf course, more standards apply:\n   1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives\nand doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie,\ndisciples).\n   Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul\n(natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly\nface to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take\nPaul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify\nhis statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the\npastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of\nother verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've\nmade a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of\nMatthew 24).",

    "And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus\nhimself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than\nheaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new\nchurches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,\nchapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word\n\"throne\" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the\nassignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are\nalready judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no\nrecourse, excuse or defense.\n\nYes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\nextremes before stopping at \"moderation.\"  I think we have seen the extreme of\nthe \"hell fire & brimstone\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\nsensibilities.\n\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\npoint of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\nwouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\n\nI'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. \nWhen I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that\nisn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. \nIt's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\nis still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness\nwhich includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,\nthen broad is the way to distruction.\n\n\nI think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,\nrepentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!\nNo, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we\nshould do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  \n\nI have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I\nwould say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its\neternality.\n\n1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.\n2) Dignity of Man.

    "The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux\ndid not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.

    "Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who\ndie young, etc. ?\n\n\n\n\n   But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is\nsomething akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.\n\n\n\n   I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond \nbodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe\nthey're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand\nthat you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows\nthat all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want\nto say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven,\nbut this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die\na final death))\n\n   I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_\nsort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and\nnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that\nthere will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. \n(assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll\nnever know I'm dead. Hmmm... \n\n\n\n    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:\n \"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\" ?\n\n    Consider the following statement:\n \"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\"\n\n    The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, \nit would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. \nGranted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any\nconscious experience whatsoever). \n\n    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning \nto a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \n\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\nIt's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\nsuper-survival. \n\n \n\n    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and \nan eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,\nI might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to\nconvert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_\nby Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. \n\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\" asked an\nEskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something\nto the effect of, \"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting?\nScram.\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an\naccount of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no \nimmortality). \n\n\n\n\n   Pax,",
    "In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a\nproject.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in\nhassles.\n\nThe important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to\nthe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.

Of course,\nyou *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns\nand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.\n\nThe major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for\nmore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.\nFor what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop\na new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.

    "-*----\nI agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in\nthis thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand\non two of her comments.\n\n\nOne of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning\nabout empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,\nscope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of\nevidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the\nback of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be\nfilled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a\ngrave mistake to confuse these.\n\nPast snippets from this thread:\n\n\n\nBack to Lee Lady:\n\n\nThese posters are making the mistake that I have previously\ncriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A \"carefully\ndesigned and controlled study\" is neither always possible nor\nalways important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a\nremedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we\nhave enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind\nof claim to ask for a \"carefully designed and controlled study\"\nto alleviate our skepticism.)\n\nRules such as \"support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and\ncontrolled study\" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.\nI think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be\nconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have\noccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To\nreuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\nuncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\nproblems are notoriously problematic.)",

Other information\n\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n\tuseful when used with Windows.\n\n\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\n\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\n\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \n\tto pay up for RSI management tools.  \n\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tRAN Enterprises\n\tOne Woodland Park Dr.\n\tHaverhill, MA  01830, US\n\tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally\n\tdisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\n\tanimated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the\n\tcorrect rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training \n\texercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions\n\tyou do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help \n\ton workplace ergonomics.  \n\n\tQuote from their literature:\n\n\t\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic\n\tsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work\n\tall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent\n\tRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve\n\tyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these\n\thelp you to become more relaxed and productive.\"\n \n\t\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.\n\tGodnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup\n\tfor a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to\n\tpromote healthy and efficient computer use. \n\t\n\tCost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts\n\tfor resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\n\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\n\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\n\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n\tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not\n\trequire any sound hardware.\n\n    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tVisionary Software\n\tP.O.

It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)",
    "But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a\nnon-existent danger?  Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both\nsides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your\nrespective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.\n\nThe important point to note is the different directions both sides come from.\nChristians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right\n(and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.  \n\nChristians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently\nto them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get\noffended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.\n\n(BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)\n\nNeither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their\nmind.

    "I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation.\nThat's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like\nso many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.\n\nI strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I\ndeign from commenting much further.\n\n\nNow hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as\nmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that\nChristians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if\nyou believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily\nbeing arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,\nbut he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.\n \n\nNot quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*\ndetermine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible\nhuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The \ndistinction is subtle yet important.\n\nWhen a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results\nare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could\nhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,\nwithout sacrificing his convictions.\n\nNobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.\nThroughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know\nwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the\nright direction when he uttered, \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" yet we have not advanced\nmuch beyond that.\n\nDo you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that\nthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely\ncertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,\nyou have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all\npractical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with\nChristianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about\nabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability \nthat they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) \nabandon these absolutes.\n\n\nAs I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does\nnot mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to \nrender all doubts unreasonable.",

    "believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do > not\ndeny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions > from\nevidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on > the\nevidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any >\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the >\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere > is\nnot self explanatory). \n\nSo your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since\nthis is the only other source of information left to us).\nHow can you then convince somebody that your \"feelings and experiences\"\nare the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible and\nmeasurable effects?  If my experiences say that \"there exists no god\"\nand yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only\ngoing on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal\nrealities.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with \"feelings and experiences\" is that they\ncan lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I\nam sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but\nI think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.\n\nFinally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical\nsphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?\n\n\nYou must be using a definition of \"evidence\" that I am not familiar with.\nTo me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that\nwhat you are saying is true.\n\nHowever, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.\nIt is not something you can share around - others must experience it\nindependantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts\nbelief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians\ndo not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of\nthese things can go.\n\n\nAt the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously, \nthe trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY\nclaim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best\nevidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it\nshould read \"for explaining the non-existence of God\").  So not only\nmust you \"prove\" your own case, you have to \"disprove\" theirs.\n\n(alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief\nof their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)\n\n\nI know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don't.\nI just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes\nwithout saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct\nme.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the \nnon-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made\nsome progress towards the truth.",
    "David,\n\n  As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive)\nmarket is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong \nencryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast\nstandard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard,\nbut it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market\nwith cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better,\nthe programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard.\nWho could compete?\n\n  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures\nthat it will be voluntary in the future.

    "I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned\nexamples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a\ncouple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not\nmissing something obvious here...)\n\nBasic Scenario:\n\n\tI set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of\n\tfiles on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users \n\tconnect they send a private key encrypted using the system public\n\tkey and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the\n\tone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The\n\tresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it\n\tis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the\n\tmachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed\n\tsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personal\n\tprivate keys during the authentication sequence.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\tDoes the fact that the system private key does not provide any\n\tinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far as\n\tbeing coerced to reveal the key?

    "In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks\nto people, where a person just \"came to know\" some piece\nof information, where a person walks off into the desert\nfor \"40 days\", etc. With all of God's power He certainly can\ndo whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible \"ends\"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No.\nSo who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer\nhappening or still happening ?\n\nI can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-)\nWith the cold response I've gotten from the past from this\ngroup, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only\ngo over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look\nat documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted\nbodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-)\nThe apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle\nspecifically granted to show God's existence. That was\nthe spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several\ncountries. That event is \"approved\" by the Pope. Currently,\nimages of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa\nare showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under\ninvestigation by the Church. But realize that investigations\ntake decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come\nin ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-).\nOther events under investigation are inner locutions (\"coming\nto know\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds.

Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M\nor God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're\nhappening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody\ncan figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion.\nIf you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned.\nThese are not \"members only\" events. God and Mary invites \neverybody.\n\nSo in conclusion (finally) ...\nWe RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary.\nWe are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to.\nThere are more proofs and events. And that is why \"not everything\nis in the Bible\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told\nto read the Bible.\n\nAs far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned...\nIn the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how.\nI have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry\nabout the \"versus\" part. Just do God's work. That's all\nthat matters. Unity will come.\n\nBTW, I'm just a plain person.

    "I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post, but that's\nwhat I get from posting at 1 am...\n\nThe central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to\nplay by the rules and get warrants, legit escrowed keys, etc., may find\nthemselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting\nat the federal level.  \n\nI disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy\ncops.  It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more\npolice agencies to \"go rogue\" and try to get keys through more efficient\n\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n        decipher the message?\n\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^\n        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe clear implication is that there are \"legal\" authorizations other\nthan a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who \nknows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There\nmay well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which\nkeys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent\nposition to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They\nalready have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There\nare a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access\npolice communications (or use the information they get).  It may be\nvery difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such\nevidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.\n\nThrow in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional\nrestrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've \"retired\" from intelligence\nagencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.\n\nDon't think it'll happen?  \n\nWell, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional\norganization, which for years kept \"Red Files\" on thousands of suspected \ncommies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards\nof evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they\nhappened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship\nrally was happening -- the police went around writing down license\nplate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the \nmeeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.\n(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any\nmore such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes\nas well.)\n\nEven with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will \nbe strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need\nto assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest \nof enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  \nCompromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) \nwill be a moral dilemma.\n\nClipper will make criminals out of cops.

    "Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for\nKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.\n\n\nWell, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite\naccurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\nbad judgement call.\n\n\n\n\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\nhustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\nretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\nnow is the Gulls.\n\n\n\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\nfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he\nwas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.\n\n\nAgreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you\nwish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you\ncan really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have\ntrouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and\nmy views from the ice differ in numerous ways)\n\n\n\nCoffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.\n\n\n\nYou? Nah... \n\nHe was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as\nfew games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate\nto judge the talent too quickly.

    "(excerpts from posting on this topic) \n\n\n(I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o) \n\n\nNow my comments: \n\nI'd like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.",

At\nnuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas\nfossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot\nwater.

    "And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-\nBernstein.  See his book, \"Discovering\".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don't think \"extra-scientific\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the \"Newton of mirror-image life,\" which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).",

    "\"fete\"???

Given that, however, there \n*is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in \nGaza.  \n\nJust as international law recognizes the right of the occupying \nentity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements\nthat are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. \nIronically, international law recognizes each of these focusses\n(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are \ninherently in conflict.\n\nIsrael certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present\npolicies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third \nalternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish \"dhimmi\"\nsystem with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly \"protected\" citizens.\nWould you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with\nregard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?\n \n\nIt is a race, then?

Since the primary targets of help are\nMuslim victims of \"ethnic cleansing\", you imply that such Muslim victims are\nbutchers.\n\n\nThis implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or\nimpossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that\nvictims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities\non the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?\n\n\nYes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not\nbe \"ethnic cleansed\".  The Serbians want to \"ethnic cleanse\" the Muslims.  It\nis indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the\nthings that the two sides want are not equivalent.\n\n\nI recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying\nthat the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to\nSomalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider\nunworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to\nthe opposite place than that predicted by the theory.\n\nFor that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to\nhelp the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If\nthe desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are\nless like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?\nEspecially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?\n--\n\"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?

    "You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be\ncontentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\nand authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\nWhat prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\nPapal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\nThis is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\nstood by the Pope.\n\nIt appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\ndisagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\nauthority and discipline.  \n\nMy question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n  don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\nIf not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\nIf I adopt the view that \"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\nthere's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\nI've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nThe Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction\nviewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical\nCouncils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines \nregarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of\nthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into\nthe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that\na split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games\nlike \"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does\nis effective...\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.\n\n\nWe sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\nEast and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n \n\nI thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\nerror in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\nI may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nWhat would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\nregarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?

SSPX does not view the\nPope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\n \n\nTrue enough.\n\n\nOne could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction.\nI don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.\n \nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--",

Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which\nthey have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish \nchauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed \nanything other than a paranoid Turkish military. \n\n[HE]\tSearch Turkish planes?

Ooops, I forgot, Kuwaitis are\n  \"oil rich\", \"loaded with petro-dollars\", etc so they don't count.\n\n...and let's not forget Somalia, which is about as far from white as it\ngets.",
    "Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with\nnobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?\n\nMost runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the\nbatter did something good.  I use the phrase \"happened to be\" advisedly.\nLots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the\nmost ability to \"turn it up a notch\" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and\nwhat they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an\nability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who\ntend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base\nend up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by\nbeing in position.  \n\n\nI agree.",

His speed, skating ability, and puck control is\n: exceptional -- he is the one to watch on the Kings.\n: \n\nI agree, with Marty McSorely and Warren Rychel running a close second and \nthird. I am surprised more people have not noted Knickle as the biggest\nsurprise, even though I personally do not really rate him well. The biggest \ndisappointment has to be Carson. Though this is really unfair, since too much \nwas expected of him. The second biggest disappointment is Melrose, with his \nadolescent handling of the goaltending problems. Putting Hrudey on the bench \nfor a month is just stupid. It did not contribute to the team coming out of \nits slump. MVP is surely Robitaille.",
    "Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not\n_The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't\nremember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola,\ntravelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when\none of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction\nof the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven.\nBut the notion is not pursued further than that.",
    "[stuff deleted for brevity]\n\n\nYour very starting point is wrong.  Christianity is not based on following\na moral standard.  \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith...\nNOT BY WORKS so that no man may boast.\"  (Eph. 2:7-8)  You say that\nyou know the Bible well, and can recognize (do you mean recite?) many\npassages from memory.  That could very well be so.  However, it looks like\nthere are a few more passages that you should pay attention to.  (Titus 3:5\nand James 2:10 are among them.)\n\nObedience to the moral law is imporant.  However, it is supposed to be the\nresult of turning your life over to Christ and becoming a Christian.  It is\nby no means the starting point.",
    ":    Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely\n: as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant\n: to \"practical cryptanalysis.\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how\n: several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite\n: security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And\n: NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of\n: police organizations and courts across the land.\n\nAh yes, don't anyone mention Ronald William Pelton[*], heh heh heh.  How\nembarrassing.",
